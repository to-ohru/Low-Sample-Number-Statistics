Outlier Analysis for Low Sample Number Statistics

Extensive work exists in the literature to support rejection of outliers for small sample sets, such as the use of the Dixon Test. This study will create model stes to explore different techniques and there worthyness and ease of applicability to differnt real life engienering scenarios. 

R, and JMP will primarly be employed. 

A library of applied test methods and test cases will be created with the mind of re-usability. Also, the eventual publishing of the work is the ultimate goal. 

The use of these techniques is important economically whent he experiment number must be kept low (often due to economic considerations), and the consideration of rejection of a outlier in a given data set is important.
